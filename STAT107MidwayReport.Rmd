To begin, this report was made in conjunction with Tiffany Huang, Shafin Kazi, and Derek De Gracia for STAT107 at UCR taught by Jose Sanchez Gomez

We first begin by loading the data in a readable format.
```{r}
database_24_25 <- read_csv("database_24_25.csv")
#View(database_24_25)
#summary(database_24_25)
head(database_24_25)
```

As the data appears to be complete but not sorted, cleaning does not appear to be necessary, however we will apply sorting as a code to run. Additionally, our focus is primarily on a team's wins, and their 3-point shooting percentage as of right now. We can remove all other data except for those mentioned above and their raw data.
```{r}

```

Our research question is "Do NBA teams with higher 3-point shooting percentages (3P%) tend to win more games during the 2024–25 season?"

We can begin with a linear regression in order to determine the correlation between shooting a higher 3-point percentage with the number of wins this an individual team has.
```{r}
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data) # Fit linear model
```

We follow this by creating a significance test to determine its significance and how probable this correlation is.
