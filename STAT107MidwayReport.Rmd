To begin, this report was made in conjunction with Tiffany Huang, Shafin Kazi, and Derek De Gracia for STAT107 at UCR taught by Jose Sanchez Gomez This project explores the statistical relationship between NBA team success (wins) and three-point shooting performance (3P%) for the 2024–2025 NBA season. Our research question is "Do NBA teams with higher 3-point shooting percentages (3P%) tend to win more games during the 2024–25 season?"

Abstract:
The purpose of this project is to explore whether there is a significant relationship between three-point shooting efficiency and overall team success in the National Basketball Association (NBA) during the 2024–2025 season. Using publicly available team statistics on Kaggle, we computed each team’s average three-point percentage (3P%) and total number of wins as of the current season. Our preliminary analysis summarizes team-level averages and investigates the correlation between shooting accuracy from beyond the arc and total wins. This study is motivated by the modern NBA’s growing reliance on perimeter shooting as a defining characteristic of team performance. By employing linear regression, significance testing, and visualization methods, we aim to determine whether higher three-point efficiency statistically predicts greater team success. These results may provide insight into how shooting efficiency continues to shape competitive dynamics in professional basketball.

Introduction:
Historically, professional basketball has been transofmred by an analytical approach to efficiency and competition. Teams such as the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets have demonstrated that success in the NBA can greatly depend on these statistics as they maximize shooting effiency and percentage. Coaches and analysts have turned to these tools to help quantify the impact of three-point shots on performance on overall team outcomes. 

Following the abstract, the objective of this project is to examine the nature of how team statistics affect their winning rates and more explicitly, whether or not having a higher 3-pt percentage rate helps teams achieve greater success during the 2024-2025 NBA season. By utilizing public data and aggregating them at a team level to compute seasonal averages it allows analysts and enthusiaists to clearly compare NBA teams and their statistics.

Data Section:
We first begin by loading the data in a readable format.
```{r}
database_24_25 <- read_csv("database_24_25.csv")
#View(database_24_25)
#summary(database_24_25)
head(database_24_25)
```

As the data appears to be complete but not sorted, cleaning does not appear to be necessary, however we will sort through the data by using code. Additionally, our focus is primarily on a team's wins, and their 3-point shooting percentage as of right now. We can remove all other data except for those mentioned above and their raw data.
```{r}
team_summary <- database_24_25 %>%
  group_by(Tm) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_3P_pct = mean(`3P%`, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_games = n_distinct(Data),
    wins = sum(Res == "W"),
    losses = sum(Res == "L")
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_3P_pct))

print(team_summary)
```

We can begin with a linear regression in order to determine the correlation between shooting a higher 3-point percentage with the number of wins this an individual team has.
```{r}

```
The above is a temporary placeholder.

We then follow this up with a t test in order to determine significance and how probable this correlation is.
```{r}
# Compare average 3P% between winning and losing teams
t_test_result <- t.test(team_summary$avg_3P_pct, team_summary$wins, data = team_summary)
print(t_test_result)
```
